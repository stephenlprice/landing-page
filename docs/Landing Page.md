**Can I update this landing page?**

Yes, you can edit or completely replace this example template using [Stoplight Flavoured Markdown](https://meta.stoplight.io/docs/studio/docs/Documentation/03a-stoplight-flavored-markdown.md) from the [workspace settings](admin/basics).

**Is this documentation publicly accessible?**

You can use this documentation for both public and private use. Adjust project visibility settings to decide which projects are public, internal, or private. Public projects are viewable by anonymous visitors, while internal projects can be accessed by the members of your Stoplight workspace. Private projects can be shared with particular workspace members from the project settings.

**How do I update the documentation?**

Documentation is always in sync with changes that you make in Studio or your Git repo. The content in your Git repository is your source of truth for the documentation.

**Is it possible to change the theme and publish this to a custom domain?**

Both of these features will be available soon.
