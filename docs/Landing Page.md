#### With this workspace, you can: 

- Share interactive documentation with internal and external stakeholders
- Explore your APIs, track dependencies and view changelogs
- Invite team members to collaborate on API assets
- Create and update API designs and documentation
***

## Getting Started

Dig into the [documentation and quickstarts](https://meta.stoplight.io) to govern, design, and document APIs. The workspace has you covered with everything from an interactive API explorer, automatic mock servers, OpenAPI designer, API console, code samples in your favorite languages, and comprehensive examples.

<!-- theme: warning -->

>If you are a member of this workspace, please log in [here](auth) üîê.

## üõ† Design

Help architects design beautiful APIs quickly. Use `Studio` to write actionable ***API descriptions*** that can power your development workflow. Enjoy the benefits of ***split-stack development***, up-to-date documentation and the developer experience you deserve!

## üìñ Document

Provide an amazing ***developer experience*** for internal and external developers. Keep your documentation up to date with built-in ***git webhooks*** or add the CLI to your CI pipelines. Manage ***multiple versions*** of documentation with branches.

### Code Generation

Client-side code generation is provided by the API documentation automatically. Here is an example:

```javascript
var data = null;

var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
xhr.withCredentials = true;

xhr.addEventListener("readystatechange", function () {
  if (this.readyState === this.DONE) {
    console.log(this.responseText);
  }
});

xhr.open("GET", "https://cloudhome.io/api/devices/123?spaceid=all&sort=desc&limit=10");
xhr.setRequestHeader("deviceid", "all");
xhr.setRequestHeader("apikey", "123");

xhr.send(data);
```
